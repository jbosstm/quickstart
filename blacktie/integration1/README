NOTE: You may like to create a backup of this folder before starting!

NOTE: If you are using IPv6 you will need to change any references to localhost in the btconfig.xml files to be localhost4 or 127.0.0.1

NOTE: If you have launched the JBoss AS on a different interface to localhost you will have to update the following files with the updated
IP address:
	<BLACKTIE_HOME>/quickstarts/integration1/ejb/ear/pom.xml
	<BLACKTIE_HOME>/quickstarts/integration1/xatmi_adapter/ear/pom.xml
	<BLACKTIE_HOME>/quickstarts/integration1/xatmi_adapter/src/main/resources/btconfig.xml


0. OVERVIEW
This quickstart shows how a C client can invoke an EJB within the scope of the same transaction.

1. SET ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
In order to run the quickstart you need to make sure that you have set the environment
variables JBOSSAS_IP_ADDR and BLACKTIE_HOME appropriately.
On Linux you need to edit:
	$BLACKTIE_HOME/setenv.sh
On Windows:
	%BLACKTIE_HOME%\setenv.bat
Then, execute the script setenv
On Windows: 
You MUST use an environment configured with the VC++ development tools, e.g. launch:
C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat

2. INSTALL THE BLACKTIE SUBSYSTEM AND DEPLOY THE ADMIN SERVICE
Follow the instructions in $BLACKTIE_HOME/README

3. RUN THE APPLICATION SERVER
Make sure that the naming, messaging and transaction services are running, by running the JBoss server:
<JBOSS_HOME>/bin/standalone.sh|bat -c standalone-blacktie.xml -Djboss.bind.address=$JBOSSAS_IP_ADDR -Djboss.bind.address.unsecure=$JBOSSAS_IP_ADDR

4. RUN THE TRADITIONAL XATMI SERVICE

4.1. CREATE THE SERVER
NOTE: Alternatively you can try our (quickstart) makefile
cd into xatmi_service
make clean log4cxx.properties server
NOTE: Standard instructions
cd into xatmi_service
generate_server -Dservice.names=CREDITEXAMPLE,DEBITEXAMPLE -Dserver.includes=CreditService.c,DebitService.c
NOTE: If you get the following error you have not installed ant-contrib into your ANT distribution:
	BUILD FAILED
	/home/tom/blacktie/dist/blacktie-5.5.33.Final-SNAPSHOT/bin/generate-executables.xml:160: Problem: failed to create task or type propertycopy
NOTE: If you get the following error you have not installed cpp-tasks into your ANT distribution:
	BUILD FAILED
	/home/tom/blacktie/dist/blacktie-5.5.33.Final-SNAPSHOT/bin/generate-executables.xml:113: The following error occurred while executing this line:

NOTE: On Windows - If you get the following error you have not used a command prompt with VC++ tools in it:
BUILD FAILED
C:\blacktie\dist\blacktie-5.5.33.Final-SNAPSHOT\bin\generate-executables.xml:117: The following error occurred while executing this line:

\blacktie\dist\blacktie-5.5.33.Final-SNAPSHOT\quickstarts\xatmi\fooapp\target\classes"): CreateProcess error=2, The system cannot find the file specified

4.2. RUN THE SERVER
cd into xatmi_service
btadmin startup
NOTE: If you get the following error you have not started the JBoss server:
2009-06-23 08:51:51,270 [0x7f627be63750] ERROR AtmiBrokerServer          - serverinit - Unexpected CORBA exception: TRANSIENT
2009-06-23 08:51:51,270 [0x7f627be63750] INFO  AtmiBrokerLogc            - main Unexpected exception in serverrun()

4.3. BUILD AND RUN THE CLIENT
cd into client
Once the XATMI service and EJB are deployed fully into the application server, you can build the client.
generate_client -Dclient.includes=client.c
./client
NOTE: Alternatively you can try our (quickstart) makefile
cd into client
make clean log4cxx.properties client
./client

4.3 SHUTDOWN THE SERVER
cd into xatmi_service
btadmin shutdown
NOTE: If you get the following error you have not started the JBoss server:
2009-06-23 08:51:51,270 [0x7f627be63750] ERROR AtmiBrokerServer          - serverinit - Unexpected CORBA exception: TRANSIENT

5. RUN THE MIGRATED XATMI SERVICE

5.1. DEPLOY THE EJB
cd ejb
mvn install
cd ear
mvn install
mvn jboss:deploy

5.2. DEPLOY THE XATMI ADAPTER
cd xatmi_adapter
mvn install
cd ear
mvn install
mvn jboss:deploy

5.3. BUILD AND RUN THE CLIENT
cd into client
Once the XATMI service and EJB are deployed fully into the application server, you can build the client@
generate_client -Dclient.includes=client.c
./client
NOTE: Alternatively you can try our (quickstart) makefile
cd into client
make clean log4cxx.properties client
./client

5.4 UNDEPLOY THE SERVICES
cd ejb/ear
mvn jboss:undeploy
cd xatmi_adapter/ear
mvn jboss:undeploy
