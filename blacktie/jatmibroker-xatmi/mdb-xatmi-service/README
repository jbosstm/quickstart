NOTE: You may like to create a backup of this folder before starting!

NOTE: If you are using IPv6 you will need to change any references to localhost in the btconfig.xml
config files to be localhost4 or 127.0.0.1

NOTE: If you have launched the JBoss AS on a different interface to localhost you will have to update the following files with the updated
IP address:
	<BLACKTIE_HOME>/quickstarts/mdb/src/main/resources/btconfig.xml

1. SET ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
In order to run the quickstart you need to make sure that you have set the environment
variables BLACKTIE_HOME and JBOSSAS_IP_ADDR appropriately.
On Linux you need to edit:
	$BLACKTIE_HOME/setenv.sh
On Windows:
	%BLACKTIE_HOME%\setenv.bat
Then, execute the script setenv

2. INSTALL THE BLACKTIE SUBSYSTEM AND DEPLOY THE ADMIN SERVICE
Follow the instructions in https://github.com/jbosstm/narayana/blob/master/blacktie/blacktie/README

3. RUN JBOSS
NOTE: Make sure you have blacktie-admin-services installed
<JBOSS_HOME>/bin/standalone.sh|bat -c standalone-blacktie.xml -Djboss.bind.address=$JBOSSAS_IP_ADDR -Djboss.bind.address.unsecure=$JBOSSAS_IP_ADDR

4. RUN THE EXAMPLE
This quickstart makes use of maven to build, deploy and test an XATMI service deployed 
as an MDB.

Type:
	mvn package jboss:redeploy -DskipTests
	mvn surefire:test
You need to do these in two seperate stages due to a bug in HornetQ which means that
the call to deploy will return before the queues are created.

After this bug was fixed you would be able to call:
	mvn install
But you will need to uncomment the call to skip in the pom.xml
