1. SET ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
In order to run the quickstart you need to make sure that you have set the environment
variables JBOSSAS_IP_ADDR and BLACKTIE_HOME appropriately.
On Linux you need to edit:
	$BLACKTIE_HOME/setenv.sh
On Windows:
	%BLACKTIE_HOME%\setenv.bat
Then, execute the script setenv

On Windows: 
You MUST use an environment configured with the VC++ development tools, e.g. launch:
C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat
