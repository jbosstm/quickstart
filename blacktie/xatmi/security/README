NOTE: If you are using IPv6 you will need to change any references to localhost in the btconfig.xml files to be localhost4 or 127.0.0.1

1. INTRODUCTION
This quickstart shows how the services may be secured using the <security> element
in the btconfig.xml

NOTE: This quickstart makes use of default users provided in JBoss 5.1.0.GA, "guest"
and "dynsub". "guest" has the role "guest", and "dynsub" has the role "publisher"
and "durpublisher".
These users are provided out of the box for JBM 1.4 and were chosen as they have 
non-overlapping roles so we can show how to excluded "guest" users from certain 
queues.

2. SET ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
In order to run the quickstart you need to make sure that you have set the environment
variables JBOSSAS_IP_ADDR and BLACKTIE_HOME appropriately.
On Linux you need to edit:
	$BLACKTIE_HOME/setenv.sh
On Windows:
	%BLACKTIE_HOME%\setenv.bat
Then, execute the script setenv

On Windows: 
You MUST use an environment configured with the VC++ development tools, e.g. launch:
C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat


3. CREATE THE SERVER
generate_server -Dservice.names=SECURE -Dserver.includes=BarService.c
NOTE: If you get the following error you have not installed ant-contrib into your ANT distribution:
	BUILD FAILED
	/home/tom/blacktie/dist/blacktie-5.2.8.Final-SNAPSHOT/bin/generate-executables.xml:160: Problem: failed to create task or type propertycopy
NOTE: If you get the following error you have not installed cpp-tasks into your ANT distribution:
	BUILD FAILED
	/home/tom/blacktie/dist/blacktie-5.2.8.Final-SNAPSHOT/bin/generate-executables.xml:113: The following error occurred while executing this line:
	/home/tom/blacktie/dist/blacktie-5.2.8.Final-SNAPSHOT/bin/generate-executables.xml:140: Problem: failed to create task or type cc
NOTE: If you get the following error you have not edited or executed setenv correctly:

4. CREATE THE CLIENT
generate_client -Dclient.includes=client.c


5. DEPLOY THE STOMPCONNECTSERVICE
Undeploy any older versions of the blacktie admin service
Copy the file $BLACKTIE_HOME/blacktie-admin-services/blacktie-admin-services-<VERSION>.ear into $JBOSS_HOME/server/all-with-hornetq/deploy
Copy the file $BLACKTIE_HOME/blacktie-admin-services/stompconnectservice-<VERSION.ear into $JBOSS_HOME/server/all-with-hornetq/deploy


6. RUN AND CONFIGURE THE APPLICATION SERVER
Make sure that the naming, messaging and transaction services are running, by running the JBoss server:
<JBOSS_HOME>/bin/run.sh|bat -c all-with-hornetq
You will need to configure the security settings at the HornetQ level in this release of BlackTie and moving forward.
What you will need to do is:
6.1 CONFIGURE USERS AND ROLES
Edit <JBOSS_HOME>/server/all-with-hornetq/conf/props/hornetq-users.properties to add the user dynsub with password dynsub
Edit <JBOSS_HOME>/server/all-with-hornetq/conf/props/hornetq-roles.properties to give the user dynsub the role blacktie
6.2 CONFIGURE THE SECURITY SETTINGS FOR THIS SERVER
Edit <JBOSS_HOME>/server/all-with-hornetq/deploy/hornetq.sar/hornetq-configuration.xml to add the following security-settings:
      <security-setting match="jms.queue.BTR_SECURE">
         <permission type="send" roles="blacktie"/>
         <permission type="consume" roles="blacktie"/>
      </security-setting>
NOTE: The security settings are done before the queue is even deployed, this is a feature of HornetQ


7. RUN THE APPLICATIONS
As the username/password is encoded in the btconfig.xml file, for this 
quickstart we have separated the configuration for the server and each of the
clients. Therefore the BLACKTIE_CONFIGURATION_DIR environment variable 
will need to be exported.
NOTE: If you get the following error you have not sourced setenv.sh|bat
./<EXECUTABLE>: error while loading shared libraries: libTAO_CosNaming.so.1.6.7: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directoryI

7.1 RUN THE SERVER
export BLACKTIE_CONFIGURATION_DIR=serv
btadmin startup secure
NOTE: If you get the following error you have not started the JBoss server:
2009-06-23 08:51:51,270 [0x7f627be63750] ERROR AtmiBrokerServer          - serverinit - Unexpected CORBA exception: TRANSIENT
2009-06-23 08:51:51,270 [0x7f627be63750] INFO  AtmiBrokerLogc            - main Unexpected exception in serverrun()

7.2 RUN THE CLIENT WITH INVALID CREDENTIALS
export BLACKTIE_CONFIGURATION_DIR=guest
./client
If you echo $? you will see the application returned an error

7.3 RUN THE CLIENT WITH VALID CREDENTIALS
export BLACKTIE_CONFIGURATION_DIR=dynsub
./client
If you echo $? you will see the application completed successfully

7.4 SHUTDOWN THE SERVER
btadmin shutdown

8. CREATE A NEW USER AND RUN THE TEST AGAIN
Duplicate the "dynsub" folder as "bt"
Edit bt/btconfig.xml and change "dynsub" to "bt", with password "pwd"
Edit serv/btconfig.xml and change "dynsub" to "bt", with password "pwd"

Edit: "serv/btconfig.xml" and <JBOSS_HOME>/server/all-with-hornetq/conf/btconfig.xml
Change the roles with name "publisher" to "blacktie"
Remove the "guest" role

Open:  <JBOSS_HOME>/server/all-with-hornetq/deploy/messaging/hsqldb-persistence-service.xml
Add:
POPULATE.TABLES.15  = INSERT INTO JBM_USER (USER_ID, PASSWD) VALUES ('bt', 'pwd')
POPULATE.TABLES.16 = INSERT INTO JBM_ROLE (ROLE_ID, USER_ID) VALUES ('blacktie','bt')


Edit: <JBOSS_HOME>/server/all-with-hornetq/conf/btconfig.xml
Change the user from "guest"/"guest" to "bt"/"pwd"

Run step 7.1 above
Run step 7.2 above
Run step 7.3 above (this time the dynsub test will fail)

export BLACKTIE_CONFIGURATION_DIR=bt
./client
If you echo $? you will see the application completed successfully
Run step 7.4 above
