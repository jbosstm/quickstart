1. INTRODUCTION
===============
This quickstart shows how to use an XA compliant database with BlackTie and has been tested against
ORACLE 11g or DB2 9.7.1. 

To compile in support for ORACLE you will need to pass a preprocessor macro called ORACLE
to the BlackTie utility that generates executables (as explained below).

To compile in support of DB2 you need to pass a preprocessor macro called DB2 to the BlackTie utility
that generates executables (as explained below).

The preprocessor symbol is purely for the quickstarts use, BlackTie does not require this symbol in its
internal libraries.

To include a particular database during runtime you will need to update the BlackTie btconfig.xml file
with information specific to the required database. The quickstart xml files (in the linux and win32 directories)
includes notes and quickstarts on how to configure ORACLE and DB2 support. The instance names of databases
refered to in btconfig.xml (specified in the open string) must match the names in the products
array in the source file request.c.

ORACLE ONLY
Oracle 11g can be downloaded from:
http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/products/database/index.html (tested on release 11.1.0.6.0)
For all stages of this quickstart it is recommended that you have set ORACLE_HOME to the distribution of 
ORACLE you have installed.
IMPORTANT: You must NOT have ORACLE_SID set as we are using two resource managers in this quickstart
IMPORTANT: You must have the following databases initialized with quickstart tables: ORCL and blacktie

DB2 ONLY
DB2 can be downloaded from:
http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/db2/linux-unix-windows/download.html (tested on release IBM DB2 Express-C 9.7)
Install instructions are available at:
 http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v9r7/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.db2.luw.qb.server.doc/doc/c0050562.html
When you run the installer for DB2 Express-C choose "custom setup" and then also include the "Application Development Tools"

IMPORTANT: The quickstart assumes you have exported DB2DIR to the fully qualified include folder appropriate to your platform,
e.g. /home/blacktie/sqllib and that DB2_LIB is set correctly eg $DB2DIR/lib on 64 bit systems and $DB2DIR/lib32 on 32 bit systems
IMPORTANT: For all stages of this quickstart it is recommended that you have sourced the DB2DIR/db2profile script to initialize
the environment
IMPORTANT: DB2 requires additional shared memory to run "sysctl -w kernel.shmmax=1024000000"

IMPORTANT: If you are using multiple DB2 databases make sure they belong to the same "DB2 instance". A "DB2 instance" is a
logical database server environment. This environment is controlled by setting the environment variable DB2INSTANCE to
the user account that owns the DB2 server. For quickstart, in linux, if you installed DB2 using a user account called blacktie
then use
	export DB2INSTANCE=blacktie
(if your application needs to use different server environments then you should run seperate blacktie servers for
each target DB2 server environment.
The quickstart references two databases using alias names of BTDB1 and BTDB2 (if you are using different database aliases
then remember to change them in btconfig.xml and reqest.c). Also note that aliases are case sensitive (in fact
DB2 converts them to upper case) and 8 characters or less.

For quickstart, to create the DB2 databases using the DB2 command line tools:
unix prompt> source <DB2 instance owners home dir>/sqllib/db2profile
unix prompt> /opt/ibm/db2/V9.7/bin/db2
Command Line Processor for DB2 Client 9.7.0
db2 => db2start
db2 => create database BTDB1
db2 => create database BTDB2
db2 => quit
 
If you wish to connect to a remote instance you will need to create an instance for the client user id:
on the client
$DB2DIR/instance/db2icrt -s client <user>

And then to connect to a remote database you will need to catalog the node and database. For quickstart if the remote
database is called BTDB1 and runs on server <hostname> and the remote DB2 installation is listening on port
50001 (using tcpip) then type:
db2 => catalog tcpip node node1 remote <hostname> server 50001
db2 => catalog database BTDB1 at node node1

You will also need to make sure listening port is not blocked by any firewall rules. For quickstart on RHEL add the
following line to /etc/sysconfig/iptables :
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 50001 -j ACCEPT


2. BUILDING THE EXAMPLE
=======================

Make sure your environment is suitable for running BlackTie applications by sourcing the setenv scripts
that came with the BlackTie distribution (this includes setting the evironment variables 
JBOSSAS_IP_ADDR and BLACKTIE_HOME). On linux systems source:
    $BLACKTIE_HOME/setenv
and on windows execute:
    %BLACKTIE_HOME%\setenv.bat

On Windows: 
You MUST use an environment configured with the VC++ development tools, e.g. launch:
C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat

To compile a BlackTie client and server use the generate_client and generate_server scripts that came with the
distribution. The linux versions have a .sh suffix and windows versions have a .bat suffix.

generate_client accepts arguments that specify which files to compile (-Dclient.includes=...), location of any required
include directories (-Dx.inc.dir=) and the location of any required libraries (-Dx.lib.dir= and -Dx.libs=).
[If you need to pass in more include directories and libraries use -Dx.inc.dir2=..., -Dx.lib.dir2=... and -Dx.libs2=...
If you need even more, for quickstart testing against three different resource manager products such as when testing recovery
then use -Dx.inc.dir3=..., -Dx.lib.dir3=... and -Dx.libs3=...].
It also accepts a list of preprocessor macro definitions (-Dx.define="comma separated list of macro names"). Thus, for quickstart,
to compile the client for use with Oracle11g:

ORACLE ONLY

3. RUNNING THE EXAMPLE
======================
Undeploy any older versions of the blacktie admin service
Copy the file $BLACKTIE_HOME/blacktie-admin-services/blacktie-admin-services-<VERSION>.ear into $JBOSS_HOME/server/all-with-hornetq/deploy
Copy the file $BLACKTIE_HOME/blacktie-admin-services/stompconnectservice-<VERSION.ear into $JBOSS_HOME/server/all-with-hornetq/deploy
Start the JBoss server (<JBOSS_HOME>/bin/run.sh|bat -c all-with-hornetq)

Make sure all required libraries are on the library path:

ORACLE ONLY
Something like
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$ORACLE_HOME/lib
or
    set PATH=%PATH%;%ORACLE_HOME%\bin

DB2 ONLY
Sourcing the db2profile should put the libraries in the path
Alternatively:
    export DB2INSTANCE=blacktie
    export DB2_LIB=/home/mmusgrov/sqllib/lib32
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$DB2_LIB

or
    set PATH=%PATH%;%DB2DIR%\lib

BOTH
As above with:
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$DB2_LIB:$ORACLE_HOME/lib


3.1 START THE SERVER
====================
NOTE: You must NOT have ORACLE_SID set as we are using two resource managers in this quickstart
export BLACKTIE_CONFIGURATION=<win32|linux>
export BLACKTIE_CONFIGURATION_DIR=serv
btadmin startup

3.2 START THE CLIENT
====================
NOTE: You must NOT have ORACLE_SID set as we are using two resource managers in this quickstart
Indicate which platform the client is running on:
    export BLACKTIE_CONFIGURATION=<win32|linux>
    ./client

This runs a set of tests that exercise the various ways of interacting with resource managers. Please refer
to the source file cutil.c to see what client/server/transaction combinations are used.

[If you run more than one client from the same directory you will need to configure a unique recovery log name by
setting the following environment variable:
	export BLACKTIE_RC_LOG_NAME=<unique file name>

NOTE: If you get the following error it means you have not exported BLACKTIE_CONFIGURATION correctly:
2010-01-25 18:11:32,704 [0x7f805f2f5750] INFO  (AtmiBrokerLogc           :67  ) - TxLog setup: prod: ora - blacktie LOCAL DELETE AT SETUP
2010-01-25 18:11:32,722 [0x7f805f2f5750] WARN  (AtmiBrokerLogc           :91  ) - TxLog BAD REQ -1 db name: blacktie
2010-01-25 18:11:32,722 [0x7f805f2f5750] INFO  (AtmiBrokerLogc           :67  ) - TxLog setup: prod: ora - ORCL LOCAL DELETE AT SETUP
2010-01-25 18:11:32,723 [0x7f805f2f5750] WARN  (AtmiBrokerLogc           :91  ) - TxLog BAD REQ -1 db name: ORCL
2010-01-25 18:11:32,730 [0x7f805f2f5750] INFO  (AtmiBrokerLogc           :67  ) - TxLog Test failed (-1)

3.3 STOP THE SERVER
===================
btadmin shutdown


3.4 WHAT IF THE TESTS HANG
==========================

The most likely cause is that the test is waiting on a Database lock held by in doubt transactions. Try resolving them
using the tools that come with the database resource manager. For quickstart, with DB2 run the interactive tool db2 and
resolve using the command:
	db2 => LIST INDOUBT TRANSACTIONS WITH PROMPTING
and for Oracle use, for quickstart, sqlplus:

sqlplus ....
SQL> select LOCAL_TRAN_ID, STATE from DBA_2PC_PENDING;
SQL>  rollback force 'Oracle transaction id';

APPENDIX 1: Using HTTP (INSTEAD OF CORBA OTS) TO CONTROL TRANSACTIONS)
======================================================================
By default, BlackTie access the JBoss Transaction Manager (TM) using CORBA OTS. We also support HTTP
access to the TM. JBossTM supports HTTP by deploying a war into the application server running the TM.
I have tested on the functionaliyt on AS7.

1. Check out the latest revision (-r37473 or greater) of trunk and build the the rest-tx module.
2. Copy rest-tx/webservice/target/rest-tx-web-<version>.war to the deployments directory.
3. Edit the btconfig files in the cli and svr directories. Uncomment the TXN_CFG element:
   The MGR_URL attribute is the URL for starting transactions. The default,
        MGR_URL="http://127.0.0.1:9090/rest-tx/tx/transaction-manager"
   says that the application server is running on localhost on port 9090. I have used a non
   standard port since you will most likely be running AS6 for the XATMI comms. In a future release
   we will fully support AS7 so that you will be able to use the standard HTTP port.
   Supporting HTTP means that clients and servers need to listen on an HTTP endpoint.
   The RES_EP attribute lets clients and servers indicate which host and port to listen on
   (you can choose any provided the client and server listen on different ports - hence the
   need for different cofig files). Before starting the server export
   BLACKTIE_CONFIGURATION_DIR=svr and similarly, before starting the client export
   BLACKTIE_CONFIGURATION_DIR=cli
4. Run the example as normal.


APPENDIX 2: SIMPLE DEMO
=======================

The example runs a number of tests and then cleans up the target database afterwards (by deleting
all database rows that were inserted). For demo purposes there is a test that simple inserts a
single record into all configured databases. You can access this functionality by specifiy a key
that will be used to insert a new record into target DB.

export EMPNO=8000
and then run the example as normal. Clearly, a second run with the same key will generate an
SQL constraint violation.

APPENDIX 3: RECOVERY
====================
To test recovery you will need to link against a library that is only available in the test suite (which you'll need to build
from source - the library is called libtx-test-utilities.so).

When building the client and server define the macro TX_RC as shown below. When the client runs it sends a request to
the server that causes the server to generate a segmentation fault during the commit phase of the transaction commitment
protocol. This will ensure that there is a pending transaction in need of recovery. See the note below about running
select statements showing that one of the database instances got the commit but the other one will have the commit pending
(ie the record will not be present until the transaction is recovered).

[Note, to test failure after prepare but before the commit phase runs set TX_RC=2 when compiling the client
(an quickstart client compile line is shown below). This scenario should result in the transaction eventually being rolled back].

Restart the server. The BlackTie log (blacktie.log) should show the system recovering the failed transaction. The expected
message sequence is:

An entry that indicates BlackTie is attempting the recovery with the following message (for each failed branch):
	"... Recovering resource with branch id: <branch id> and recovery IOR: ..."
Then after one or two minutes the branch should attempt to commit with the following message:
	"... Commiting resource with branch id: <branch id>"

Note also that the Transaction Manager running in the JBoss AS should report messages on the console. One to show the
error that occurs when the server generates a segmentation fault during commit:
	"14:42:23,556 WARN  [loggerI18N] [com.arjuna.ats.internal.jts.resources.rrcaught] ResourceRecord commit - caught exception: org.omg.CORBA.TRANSIENT: Retries exceeded, couldn't reconnect to 127.0.0.1:9032  vmcid: 0x0  minor code: 0  completed: No"

and another message that indicates successful recovery of the pending transaction:
	"14:43:47,576 INFO  [loggerI18N] [com.arjuna.ats.internal.jts.recovery.transactions.TransactionCache_5] [com.arjuna.ats.internal.jts.recovery.transactions.TransactionCache_5] - Transaction 7f000001:e2a7:4aadfb4c:a89 recovery completed"

Required Configuration Changes:
-------------------------------

The XA resource that generates the segmentation fault needs to be included in btconfig.xml as follows:
            <XA_RESOURCE configuration="linux">
                <XA_RESOURCE_MGR_ID>202</XA_RESOURCE_MGR_ID>
                <XA_RESOURCE_NAME>DummyDb</XA_RESOURCE_NAME>
                <XA_OPEN_STRING></XA_OPEN_STRING>
                <XA_CLOSE_STRING></XA_CLOSE_STRING>
                <XA_SWITCH>testxasw</XA_SWITCH>
                <XA_LIB_NAME>libtx-test-utilities.so</XA_LIB_NAME>
            </XA_RESOURCE>

Make sure that the XA_RESOURCE_MGR_ID lies between the two ORACLE Resource Manager ids. This will ensure that the
ORACLE instance with the lower id will commit but the one with the higher id will not have committed.

Similarly, if you need to test against DB2 then set the XA_RESOURCE_MGR_ID appropriately. For quickstart, the default
XA_RESOURCE_MGR_ID for testing against DB2 are 302 and 304 (see btconfig.xml) then use the value 303.

The quickstart needs to be compiled with the preprocessor definition TX_RC_RMID set to the correct XA_RESOURCE_MGR_ID
(the default is 202).


The test inserts an employee with id 8004 into the emp table. After running the client:
	select empno from emp where empno=8004; should return 1 record on the db with sid ORCL
	select empno from emp where empno=8004; should return 0 records on the db with sid blacktie.

When the server is restarted and recovery is complete (should take a couple of minutes) retry the selects. This time
both instances should return 1 record.

Note that after failure the server needs to either restart on the same ORB endpoint (the easiest to configure)
or needs to use a CORBA implementaton repository:
- to use the same end point add something similar to the following in the ORBOPT environment entry (the portspan is required
since the server can start more than one orb so a range of ports is necessary):
	<NAME>ORBOPT</NAME>
    <VALUE>-ORBListenEndpoints iiop://${JBOSSAS_IP_ADDR}:9032/portspan=10 -ORBInitRef ...</VALUE>
- or to use an implementation repository:
	<NAME>ORBOPT</NAME>
	<VALUE>-ORBUseImR 1 -ORBInitRef ...</VALUE>

Quickstart command line for compiling and linking the server and client (defines the TX_RC macro and links against the
dummy XA resource library):

On Linux:
generate_client -Dclient.includes="client.c request.c ora.c cutil.c" \
     -Dx.inc.dir="$HOME/blacktie/trunk/atmibroker-tx/target/cxx/test/include" \
     -Dx.inc.dir2="$ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/public" \
     -Dx.lib.dir="$HOME/blacktie/trunk/atmibroker-tx/target/cxx/test/lib" -Dx.libs="tx-test-utilities" \
     -Dx.lib.dir2="$ORACLE_HOME/lib" -Dx.libs2="occi clntsh" \
     -Dx.define="ORACLE, TX_RC"

generate_server -Dservice.names=TXFOOAPP -Dserver.includes="request.c ora.c DbService.c" \
     -Dx.inc.dir="$HOME/blacktie/trunk/atmibroker-tx/target/cxx/test/include" \
     -Dx.inc.dir2="$ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/public" \
     -Dx.lib.dir="$HOME/blacktie/trunk/atmibroker-tx/target/cxx/test/lib" -Dx.libs="tx-test-utilities" \
     -Dx.lib.dir2="$ORACLE_HOME/lib" -Dx.libs2="occi clntsh" \
     -Dx.define="ORACLE, TX_RC"

[Note: If you need to test DB2 recovery you will need to add an extra preprocessor define (see comment above regarding the
XA_RESOURCE_MGR_ID setting for the DummyDb resource manager):

     -Dx.define="ORACLE, TX_RC,TX_RC_RMID=302" ]


On Windows:
generate_client -Dclient.includes="client.c request.c ora.c cutil.c" -Dx.inc.dir="%ORACLE_HOME%\OCI\include" -Dx.lib.dir="%ORACLE_HOME%\OCI\lib\MSVC" -Dx.libs="oci"      -Dx.inc.dir2="c:/blacktie/trunk/atmibroker-tx/target/cxx/test/include"      -Dx.lib.dir2="c:/blacktie/trunk/atmibroker-tx/target/cxx/test/lib" -Dx.libs2="tx-test-utilities"     -Dx.define="ORACLE, TX_RC"

generate_server -Dservice.names=TXFOOAPP -Dserver.includes="request.c ora.c DbService.c" -Dx.inc.dir="%ORACLE_HOME%\OCI\include" -Dx.lib.dir="%ORACLE_HOME%\OCI\lib\MSVC" -Dx.libs="oci"           -Dx.inc.dir2="C:/blacktie/trunk/atmibroker-tx/target/cxx/test/include"      -Dx.lib.dir2="c:/blacktie/trunk/atmibroker-tx/target/cxx/test/lib" -Dx.libs2="tx-test-utilities"      -Dx.define="ORACLE, TX_RC"

Note that the library path needs to include the location of the tx-test-utilities library. For quickstart:
On Linux:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$ORACLE_HOME/lib:$HOME/blacktie/trunk/atmibroker-tx/target/cxx/test/lib
On Windows:
set PATH=%PATH%;%ORACLE_HOME%/bin;c:/blacktie/trunk/atmibroker-tx/target/cxx/test/lib

Note that recovery implies that the various components in the system need to store state on disk. If things don't go according
to plan you will need to either manually recover the transaction or, since this is only a demo quickstart, manually
clear the logs:

	BlackTie recovery log: fooapp* # safe to delete these logs
	JBossTS logs: $JBOSS_HOME/server/<server name>/data/tx-object-store/
		# probably not wise to delete these unless you know that there are no other transactions in the system
