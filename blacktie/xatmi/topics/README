1. SET ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
In order to run the quickstart you need to make sure that you have set the environment
variables JBOSSAS_IP_ADDR and BLACKTIE_HOME appropriately.
On Linux you need to edit:
	$BLACKTIE_HOME/setenv.sh
On Windows:
	%BLACKTIE_HOME%\setenv.bat
Then, execute the script setenv

On Windows: 
You MUST use an environment configured with the VC++ development tools, e.g. launch:
C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat

3. CREATE THE CLIENT
generate_client -Dclient.includes=client.c


4. DEPLOY THE BLACKTIE ADMIN SERVICE
Undeploy any older versions of the blacktie admin service
Copy the file $BLACKTIE_HOME/blacktie-admin-services/blacktie-admin-services-<VERSION>.ear into $JBOSS_HOME/server/all-with-hornetq/deploy
Copy the file $BLACKTIE_HOME/blacktie-admin-services/stompconnectservice-<VERSION.ear into $JBOSS_HOME/server/all-with-hornetq/deploy


5. RUN THE APPLICATION SERVER
Make sure that the naming, messaging and transaction services are running, by running the JBoss server:
<JBOSS_HOME>/bin/run.sh|bat -c all-with-hornetq


6 RUN THE APPLICATIONS
6.1 RUN THE SERVER
btadmin startup
NOTE: If you get the following error you have not started the JBoss server:
2009-06-23 08:51:51,270 [0x7f627be63750] ERROR AtmiBrokerServer          - serverinit - Unexpected CORBA exception: TRANSIENT
2009-06-23 08:51:51,270 [0x7f627be63750] INFO  AtmiBrokerLogc            - main Unexpected exception in serverrun()
6.2 RUN THE CLIENT
./client
NOTE: If you get the following error you have not sourced setenv.sh|bat
./client: error while loading shared libraries: libTAO_CosNaming.so.1.6.7: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directoryI
6.3 SHUTDOWN THE SERVER
btadmin shutdown

multiple servers start an XATMI service on the same topic
the client must set TPNOREPLY and do a tpacall
the message from the client sending the tpacall is received by all instances of the service listening to the same topic
