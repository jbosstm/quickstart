# MicroProfile LRA API Participant Example

[MicroProfile LRA](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-lra) is a specification of an API that
enables loosely coupled services to coordinate long running activities in such a way as to
guarantee a globally consistent outcome without the need to take long duration locks on data.

This module contains a swarm jar for running a standalone LRA coordinator.

For instructions for how to run it please refer to
[the description in the lra-examples README](../README.md#running-an-external-lra-coordinator)
