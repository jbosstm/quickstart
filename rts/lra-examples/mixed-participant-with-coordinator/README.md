# MicroProfile LRA Mixed Participant With Coordinator Example

[MicroProfile LRA](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-lra) is a specification of an API that
enables loosely coupled services to coordinate long running activities in such a way as to
guarantee a globally consistent outcome without the need to take long duration locks on data.

To run the example under Unix based OS's run the maven build lifecycle verify phase:

> mvn verify

To run the example manually with a description of how it works please refer to
[the description in the lra-examples README](../README.md#running the mixed-participant-with-coordinator example)
