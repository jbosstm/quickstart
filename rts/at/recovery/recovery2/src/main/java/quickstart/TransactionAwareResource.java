/**
 * An example of how a REST resource can act as a participant in a REST Atomic transaction.
 * For a complete implementation of a participant please refer to the test suite, in particular the inner class:
 * org.jboss.jbossts.star.test.BaseTest$TransactionalResource which implements all the responsibilities of a participant
 *
 * The example sends a service request which is handled by the method someServiceRequest. The request includes the
 * URL for registering durable participants within the transaction. This naive implementation assumes every request
 * with a valid enlistment URL is a request a new unit of transactional work and enlists a new URL into the transaction.
 * Thus if a client makes two http requests to the method someServiceRequest then the participant is enlisted twice
 * into the transaction but with different completion URLs. This facilitates the demonstration of 2 phase commit
 * processing.
