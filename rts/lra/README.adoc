## Build the demo

```bash
mvn clean package

## Trip Demo

    start LRA 1
        Book hotel
        start LRA 2
            start LRA 3
                Book flight option 1
            start LRA 4
                Book flight option 2
    cancel LRA 3
    close LRA 1 (results in the hotel and flight option 2 being confirmed)

### Before you start

Obtain and unzip the Narayana distribution containing the LRA swarm coordinator to $NARAYANA_INSTALL_LOCATION
	
### Make sure the LRA coordinator and various services are running 

The trip, hotel and flight services all run in different JVMs and all listen on the different http ports.

There are two coordinators ran in the example. You can simplify this to one coordinator by not running the
second coordinator process and changing the *lra.coordinator.url* of the flight-service. Running multiple coordinators
simulates how different trust domains can interoperate.

Start the coordinators:

```bash
java -jar $NARAYANA_INSTALL_LOCATION/rts/lra/lra-coordinator-thorntail.jar -Dswarm.http.port=8080
java -jar $NARAYANA_INSTALL_LOCATION/rts/lra/lra-coordinator-thorntail.jar -Dswarm.http.port=8081
```

Start the trip, hotel and flight services:

```bash
java -jar hotel-service/target/lra-test-swarm.jar -Dswarm.http.port=8082
java -jar flight-service/target/lra-test-swarm.jar -Dswarm.http.port=8083 -Dlra.coordinator.url="http://localhost:8081/lra-coordinator"
java -jar trip-controller/target/lra-test-swarm.jar -Dswarm.http.port=8084 -Dlra.coordinator.url="http://localhost:8080/lra-coordinator"
```

The system property *lra.coordinator.url* specifies the URL on which the LRA coordinator is listening.

As you can see the flight service uses it's own coordinator to simulate a different domain
participating in the same transaction.

(If you want to enable source level debugging use -Dswarm.debug.port=<port>).

### Update a trip booking

Make a provisional booking and then amend it before confirming the booking. Apart from using
Jackson for parsing Json the client (TripClient) only uses Java SE APIs.

```bash
mvn -f trip-client/pom.xml exec:java -Dservice.http.host="localhost" -Dservice.http.port=8084
```

The system properties *lra.coordinator.url* and *service.http.port* specify the ports on which the LRA
coordinator and example service are is listening, respectively.

## Running the demo on Minishift

You will need to have installed Minishift and have the tools in your command line.

Assuming that is the case and the LRA coordinator is available in $NARAYANA_INSTALL_LOCATION/rts/lra/
you can execute the script minishift.sh to deploy the services, coordinators and execute a simple client
application.

To check the logs you can look at:
```bash
oc logs -f `oc get pods | grep ^flight-service | grep Running | awk '{ print $1 }'`
oc logs -f `oc get pods | grep ^hotel-service | grep Running | awk '{ print $1 }'`
oc logs -f `oc get pods | grep ^trip-controller | grep Running | awk '{ print $1 }'`
oc logs -f `oc get pods | grep ^lra-coordinator | grep Running | awk '{ print $1 }'`
oc logs -f `oc get pods | grep ^flight-lra-coordinator | grep Running | awk '{ print $1 }'`
```
