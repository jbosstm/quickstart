# ArjunaCore quickstarts

## Overview

ArjunaCore is the core of Narayana providing a fully functional transaction engine (TxCore) and Transactional Objects for Java (TXOJ).
It is multi-threaded, distributed, supports nested transactions, fault tolerance/recovery
and permits relaxation of subsets of the standard ACID transaction properties.

TXOJ provides desirable features such as concurrency control, state management and persistence.

All the quickstarts related to ArjunaCore are found in this folder structure.

Each quickstart also contains a script to run the quickstart automatically and check the result automatically.
