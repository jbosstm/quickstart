OVERVIEW
--------
ArjunaCore is the core of Narayana providing a fully functional transaction engine (TxCore) and Transactional Objects for Java (TXOJ). It is multi-threaded, distributed, supports nested transactions, fault tolerance/recovery and permits relaxation of subsets of the standard ACID transaction properties.

TXOJ provides desirable features such as concurrency control, state management and persistence.

All the quickstarts related to ArjunaCore are found in this folder structure. Each quickstart has a readme.txt to show how to execute the quickstart and what is happening in it. Each quickstart also contains a script to run the quickstart automatically and check the result automatically.


USAGE
-----
cd into the required quickstart and follow the readme.txt or call the run.[sh|bat] file
