This demo has been written for, and tested on, JBoss 8.0.0.Alpha1-SNAPSHOT It may work with other versions of JBoss 7.
Please download and install this app server from the JBoss website.


Note: The java.awt.headless property is needed for the demo as it starts a Java Swing user interface for each or the participant services. This is done for demonstration purposes; it is unlikely that a typical JEE application will ever do this. 


Follow these steps to build the demo for JBoss
 - add java and Maven to your path
 - ensure JBoss AS is started with XTS enabled. This can be done by specifying the standalone-xts configuration when starting JBoss AS:
    cd $JBOSS_HOME
    cp docs/examples/configs/standalone-xts.xml standalone/configuration/
    ./bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-xts.xml -Djava.awt.headless=false
 - execute 'mvn clean install' (runs tests)
 - mvn -f ear/pom.xml jboss-as:deploy (deploys the demo)
 - Open a browser and enter the xts-demo url (e.g. http://localhost:8080/xts-demo)

---------  Basic test coverage for JBossTS XTS Demo App
Author: Ivo Studensky <istudens@redhat.com>

This is some basic test coverage for the XTS Demo App. It is powered by Arquillian
and its Drone extension. By default it calls a local Firefox browser to execute the tests.

The test starts up the AS, deploys the XTS Demo App into it and runs a reservation of some
restaurant/theatre/taxi seats using both AtomicTransaction and BusinessActivity tx type.

Read the programmers guide (XTS/xts-install/docs/ProgrammersGuide.pdf) for
an explanation of how the demo works and guidelines on how to use the
XTS package to implement your own transactional web services.
