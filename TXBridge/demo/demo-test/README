---------  Basic test coverage for JBossTS TxBridge Demo App
Author: Ivo Studensky <istudens@redhat.com>

This is some basic test coverage for the TxBridge Demo App. It is powered by Arquillian
and its Drone extension. By default it calls a local Firefox browser to execute the tests.

The test starts up the AS, deploys the TxBridge Demo App bits into it and runs a reservation of some
seats using both WS-AT and JTA parent tx type (using inbound/outbound xa bridge).


--- Requirements:
1. apache maven tool
2. xts demo built in /XTS/xts-install/demo dir
3. tx bridge demo build in /txbridge/demo dir

--- Steps to run:

1. export JBOSS_HOME=<path to JBossAS >= 7.1.0.Alpha2-SNAPSHOT>
2. mvn clean test
