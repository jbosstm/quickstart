# Quickstarts

## Contacting us

We are always happy to talk transactions and how-to use Narayana in exotic and not so exotic environments. If you have ideas for what we can add to the quickstarts to make them more useful please do reach out to us over on our forum:
https://developer.jboss.org/en/jbosstm/

## Running a single quickstart

Change directory into the required quickstart and follow the instructions in the README.md file.

## Running all quickstarts in a single command

To run the quickstarts:

1. set WORKSPACE (to the root of the quickstart checkout)
2. set JBOSSAS_IP_ADDR (default is localhost)
3. set JBOSS_HOME (to the path of JBossAS server, e.g. /home/tom/projects/jbosstm/narayana/jboss-as/build/target/jboss-as-8.0.0.Alpha1-SNAPSHOT/)
4. mvn clean install

One of the BlackTie quickstarts requires the Oracle driver to be downloaded and configured, see blacktie/test/initializeBlackTie.xml for more details.

It is disabled by default but running "./blacktie/run_all_quickstarts.[sh|bat] tx" will execute it
